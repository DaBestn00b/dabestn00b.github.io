## [Swap!](http://www.ebaad.ml/swap)
The goal of the game is to travel as far as possible without dieing. You die when you don't switch colors to match the floor properly. The ball automatically rolls on the platform. In order to change color, the player must press the "Swap!" button. The score raises as time passes. The ball also speeds up. How long can you survive in the color changing world?
