# About Me
  Welcome! I am a game developer. I plan on making many more games and updates in the near future. Check out my newest app called "Swap! - The Color Runner".
# Games
## [Swap!](http://www.ebaad.ml/swap)
  The goal of the game is to travel as far as possible without dying. You die when you don't switch colors to match the floor properly. The ball automatically rolls on the platform. In order to change color, the player must press the "Swap!" button. The score raises as time passes. The ball also speeds up. How long can you survive in the color changing world?
# Coming Soon
## Mouse Life
  Collect cheese to gain score but don't get caught! How much cheese can you collect?
